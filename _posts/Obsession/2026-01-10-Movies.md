I love watching the same movies over and over again. The more you watch it, the more you find out. It's like onions, there are layers. I recently watched Shrek series like 7 times in the span of 7 days. But yeah. I would like to say I got good taste in movies. These are some movies that I really liked. Go take a peek!
