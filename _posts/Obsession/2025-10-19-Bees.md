Yes, this may be one of the most random obsession I've had. Bees. I was actually watching a bunch of instagram reels where people were taking care of their own very hive in their houses. Then, I got into beekeeper reels. Then, I started to learn more and more about them. Then this one fact about them got to me. Their societal structure. 

I believe that bees have an ideal social structure. They all do their very best in their own position for the greater good. If I were to imagine an ideal society of humans, it would be where each one of us do our very best on what we are good at to serve for the greater good. If every single one of us maximized our potential, the world would be full of great people, which would make the world such a great place to live in harmony. Realistically, it is quite impossible due to competition, ego, and many other factors. Bees however, seems to have it well structured. 

Some other interesting facts about bees... coming soon...
