So... I watched the whole series like 7 times over the span of 7 days... Well that is quite bad, but the movie is just too good. I do have this thing of watching the same thing over and over again. The more you watch it, the more you find out. It's like onions, cause it has layers. Look how nicely put quote they have in their movie. 

There are many reasons why I think Shrek is one of the best series of movies ever... coming soon...
