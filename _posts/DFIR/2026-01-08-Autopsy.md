This week, I learned more in depth of using Autopsy tool. It's an open source for analysing all types of mobile devices and digital media. 

When you are starting a new investigation, you have a create a case file for the data source. When you create a New case, you can fill in the __Case Name__, __Base Directory__, and __Case Type__. For a note, Autopsy case files have __.aut__ file extension. 

Autopsy can analyze multiple disk image formats. It supports 
1. Raw Single (.img, .dd, .raw, .bin)
2. Raw Split (.001, .00a, .aa, .ab)
3. EnCase (.e01, .e02)
4. Virtual Machines (.vmdk, .vhd)

Inside Autopsy, there is an option called __Ingest Modules__ where you can analyze and retrieve specific data from the drive. By default, it runs All Files, Directories, and Unallocated Space which can be changed.

__TREE VIEWIER__
On the left side of the tool,there is a tree viewer that contains 5 level nodes 
1. __Data Sources__ : all data organized as normal Windows File Explorer
2. __Views__ : files organized based on file types, MIME, file size
3. __Results__: results from Ingest Moduels
4. __Tags__: files and results that have been tagged
5. __Reports__: reports generated by modules or analyst

__RESULT VIEWER__
On the right side, you can find the result viewer. When a file is selected from the Tree Viewer, you can find information about the item. You can also  __Extract File__ by right clicking on the file.

The three tabs are useful for different things. Thumbnail tab works well for image or video files. 

When the __vol__ node is expanded, we can navigate the volume's contents like a typical Windows System. In the __Views__ tree node, you can find categories such as __By Extension__, __BY MIME Type__, __By Deleted Files__, and __By File Size__. 

__CONTENT VIEWER__
You can find additional information in the Contents Viewer. The columns stand for 
- S = Score (red ! : marked file, yellow triagle: suspicious) 
- C = Comment
- O = Occurence (How many times file has been seen)

__STATUS AREA__
Status area at the bottom right shows the progress bar which displays the percentage of completion. 

__DATA SOURCES SUMMARY__
When you right click on the file from the tree viewer, you can find the Data Sources Summary where it summarzies info in 9 different catgories. This is an overview of the total findings.

__GENERATE REPORT__
You can create data sheets for your investigation case. It provides all information listed under the __RESULT VIEWER__ pane. Autopsy tool can be heavy for systems with low resources. So, completing an investion with it on low resources can be slow. By using reports, you can avoid situations of freezing the system. When you generate a report by choosing format and scope, you can click __HTML Report__ to view reports which contains all of the __Result Viewer__ pane on the left side.

**6. What MD5 hash value of the binary is listed as an Interesting File?(fe18b02e890f7a789c576be8abccdc99)** <br> 

From Interesting Items, you can find Interesting Files which contains two source files. You can find the MD5 hash value for both files. I was actually not so sure which file's MD5 hash value it was looking for but I figured it's the one in the Users file since we are looking at the disk image in the computer.
