**Inside the computer**

When I was reading the slides, I figured it would be better if I take a look at them and take it apart hands on. So I used some used old computers at my work. 

Seems like modern chips already have graphic cards inside the chips and network cards are also embedded in the motherboard. The green thing in the background is the motherboard. The square thingy there is the CPU it seems like, the black thing is the fan or the heat sink and the silver part on the left seems to be the power supply. The right side silver part was where the Hard Drive was.

This one is the RAM. You can have multiple physical RAM pieces inside the computer. The bigger the ram, the faster your computer.

By typing in **systeminfo** on the command line, you can find your system specifications. 

These are some basics on how computers work.

**Why is computer forensics difficult?**
- technical difficulty : a lot of OS, applications, hardware, advanced technologies involved
- complex but connected world
- information explosion : TOO much information, different types of evidence
- involves criminal justics, law, computer science, security

(Personally, I think these are the reasons I find digital forensics so interesting. There is just so much to learn, so much to dig into it. Also, I love how it involves law and criminal justice which correlates to philosophy and how it also invovles computer science and security.)

**Hard Disk Drives**

I tried opening this but I couldn't do it. So I guess I'll just bring up the photo I have right now. There are different types of hard drives and this one is a very old SATA.

- sectors
    - minimum storage unit of a hard drive
    - files occupy an integral number of sectors regardless of the file's actual size
    - each sector has 512 bytes where 1 byte is 1 ASCII character
    - # of sectors = [# tracks (C)] x [# heads] x [# Sectors per track (CHS)] 
    - size of disk = # of sectors x 512 bytes
        - 1024 bytes = 1K
        - 1024 K = 1M
        - 1024 M = 1G

**Booting a computer**
1. Power Up --> computer runs power-on self-test(POST)
  - Boot sequence governed by BIOS ROM where it's parameters are stored in CMOS
2. Control passes to the Master Boot Record (MBR)
3. MBR points to the boot record of a selected operating system
  - "system" volume = pre-load OS
  - "boot" volume = actual load OS
4. Operating System takes control

There are two different Boot options. 
1. Legacy: limited to 4 primary partitions, 2 TB max disk size
2. UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) : 128 partitions, disks bigger than 2 TB

**WinHex**
- lists physical storage devices
- can intepret data
- master boot record

**File Systems**
- Unix and Unix-like operating systems
  - Linux: XFS, JFS, btrfs
  - Solaris
  - MacOS: Hierarchical File System(HFS)
- Microsoft
  - FAT: File allocation table
  - NTFS: New Technology File System 


Summary

Honestly, this part is still a little tricky for me and I'm still learning. Dissecting the computer definitely helped to understand things a bit better.
