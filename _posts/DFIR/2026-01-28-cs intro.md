**Why is computer forensics difficult?**
- technical difficulty : a lot of OS, applications, hardware, advanced technologies involved
- complex but connected world
- information explosion : TOO much information, different types of evidence
- involves criminal justics, law, computer science, security

Personally, I think these are the reasons I find digital forensics so interesting. There is just so much to learn, so much to dig into it. Also, I love how it involves law and criminal justice which correlates to philosophy and how it also invovles computer science and security.
