Most of the command lines here are familiar. I'll list some things that I didn't know about. 

- C:\>path : displays or sets a search path for executable files
- C:\>dir : display directories (C:\Users\Public>dir will display content of folder)
- C:\>vol : displays a disk volume label and serial number
- C:\>help
- C:\>dir workspace /Q : owner of the file
- C:\>type test.txt : shows content of file
- C:\notepad.exe test.txt: shows content of file
- C:\>copy test1.txt test2.txt : duplicate files
- C:\>ren test1.txt test11.txt : rename file
- C:\>ipconfig
- C:\>ping google.com : network connection test
- C:\>ping 123.12.123.12 : test network connection
- C:\help find : search for strings in file
- C:\>systeminfo
- C:\>wmic cpu get name / diskdrive get name, model, size : find cpu/desk info
- C:\>wmic nic get macaddress, description : MAC address of computer
- C:\>wmic process list brief : list processes

**Practice**
Make the file sys_info.bat callable at any folder 
- create a new folder (workspace4)
- copy the .bat to the new folder
- modify the path variable to add the new folder
- make sure the .bat can be executed
