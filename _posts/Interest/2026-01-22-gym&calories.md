I used to have a lot of insecurities about my body. I think as a woman, and also as someone who grew up in Korea, it is quite inevitable. I wasn't even a chubby person back in Korea but I wasn't really considered skinny either. Then, I came to Canada and gained a lot of weight from all the yummy food here. I decided to go on a diet and lost around 13-15kg in a year ish. Back then, I was just doing a lot of cardio and wasn't eating properly. I looked good (I guess for the "skinny standard") but I got sick so easily. 

Living in Canada, being "thick" was a trend back then. So, I decided to do weight training and actually learn how everything works. 
I actually started off from watching a lot of instagram reels, tiktok videos, just web searching like any other person who searches up stuff to start their fitness journey. Then, I met someone my ex lol. So he was a bodybuilder, and he actually had exquisite amount of knowledge about all the bodybuilding and fitness stuff. I would like to greatly appreciate that knowledge before my yabbers. 

Anyone who wants to start off their fitness journey, you could possibly look into my stuff for some "basic knowledge" before getting started. Knowing how the basics works and when you prove yourself that you can get it done, I think a lot of the insecurities go away. You are okay with how much you eat, how you look, how much you weight and so on. As someone who's been consistently working out since 2023 ish, I don't really care nowadays. I still work out regularly, but I don't control what I eat crazily like before nor I feel extremely obligated to go gym EVERYDAY. I just live my life healthy. I hope a lot of people out there who have insecurities about their body can read this, start their fitness journey, and conquer your mind! 

**Your Goals**<br>

Before starting a fitness journey, it's VERY important to know what your fitness goal is. Do you want to purely loose weight? Do you want to gain some muscle? Do you want to get strong? Do you want to look fit and good? It really depends on what you want. 

If you want to purely **loose weight**, you don't really HAVE to workout. All you have to do is calorie deficit. I will explain that in the calorie section. Although it is not a necessity to workout, it would definitely accelerate the process. 

If you want to **gain muscle, get strong, look good and fit**, you HAVE to workout, specifically weight training. A lot of people think that if you do a couple of weights, you're going to get so bulky and stuff but no. These people out there who are jacked has been working out for years and years with a lot of dedication. So don't worry about that. When you just start working out though, you do look a littly bulkier because of the sudden change in the body but also, you're gaining muscle below your fat which makes you LOOK bulkier. 

So for weight training, there are two main categories. There are people who want to get strong. This is specifically called **STRENGHT TRAINING**. You will be gaining a lot of muscle and strenght for this type of weight training. You would also get a lot more bulky. Now, there are also people who want to gain look good, lean, and fit. People who want to workout and stuff for the LOOKS. This is specifically called **HYPERTROPHY**. Now, if you figured out what you want to do, let's delve deeper. 

**Work out Routine** <br>

For work out routine, I can't really tell you what is the right thing. This is honestly trial and error. You have to figure out what works for you. I think the trial and error part is the part that takes the longest. For example, how many times you can workout a week, what area(chest, legs, back, arms, etc) you find important, how you like your splits, and so on. Though, I do highly recommend Jeff Nippard's routines. He did a lot of research on this particular area and his stuff are very legit. You can easily find his work out routine pdfs online. He has programs for women, for hypertrophy, strength training, and also for somewhere in the middle. You can try one out and tweak it as you go so it works the best for you. 

Once you choose what works for you, you should be doing something called **Progressive Overload**. This is actually my favourite part of working out and why I enjoy it so much. So this means you should up your weight(2.5lbs~5lbs), reps (2-3 reps), reduce break time, or increase sets(1-2 sets). This helps you keep your muscles grow and get stronger. I really enjoy this because it's I can see myself consistently getting better and better. It well aligns with my life motto of consistently trying to be a better person.  Also, this is just my side yabber but apparently, some people really enjoy gyming because they enjoy pain or they're tolerance is very high. It's like those people who get tattoos and piercings because of the joy of pain. I think I'm lowkey one of those people. 


**Food & Calories & Weight** <br>

So now, how do you actually loose "weight". Weight is all about calories. You eat a certain amount of calories and you loose a certain amount of calories. The sum of those calories decides if you're going to be losing weight or not. So if you want to lose weight, you have to go on a calorie deficit. This means you'll be eating less than how much daily an adult will be spending a day. There is actually a calculator for this.

So this website, you can punch in your weight, your height, how active you are and such and it will give you how much calories you should be intaking a day to lose x amount of weight in a span of y amount of time. Go take a peak!

Now, for the things you eat. So, there is something called a macro. Basically it's the ratio of protein, carbs, and fat you'll be intaking a day. There are different splits for this as well. For example 40% carbs, 30% protein, and 30% fat. This means out of all the food you eat, 40% of your food's calories would be in carbs. There are also splits where you eat very little carbs, very little fat, or large amount of protein. This, also is trial and error. Also, it depends on what you prioritize. For people who do weight training and want to gain muscle, I would say you should consume a lot of percentage of carbs and protein. You should intaking at least x1.5~x2.0 of your weight(kg) a day to gain muscle. I used to only eat a lot of protein which was around 40%. But, carbs are very important to actually gain muscle and also give you energy to lift more weights! 

There is an app called cronometer which is actually my fav. You can punch in what you ate, set your macros, set your weight goal, and it will automatically calculate how much you should be eating of what a day. I find it very convenient. For recipes, I highly recommend looking around tiktok. You can punch in something like "High Protein, low calorie desserts" or "High protein, low calorie meals" and such. They actually have a lot of good recipes running around in that app. 


**My Journey** <br>

So I started off working out from 2022-2023 ish. Honestly, the first year was just me going to the gym having no idea what I'm doing and just following whatever is on the internet. Then, after I met the bodybuilding guy, I started gyming HARD! I was actually doing a bit too much. I was writing down every single food I eat on my cronometer app. I was only eating meat(chicken, lean beef, lean pork, turkey), some seafood, whole carbs(brown rice, oatmeal, quinoa, whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, etc), and healthy fats (avocado, eggs, almonds, chia seeds, yogurt, milk) etc. I was cutting hard but also gyming hard. Around that time, I think I was deadlifting up to 195lbs 2-3 reps, squatting 135lbs up to 5-6 reps, and benching up to 60lbs 5-6 reps ish. But also, I was super lean so imagine how much I was keeping track of all the food and all the working out I'm doing. For the workout routine, I was actually doing one of those Jeff Nippard's hypertrophy&strength program. This one, you kind of hit one or two workouts per area every single day. 

After a year ish of doing this. I was so sick of living my life like that. I couldn't eat what I want to eat and I would get frustrated if I don't go to the gym. Also, I realized it's not like I'm trying to do a competition or anything. Then, I just started to eat whatever and I changed up my workout routine. I mean I still try to eat healthy carbs, healthy fats, hit my daily protein and carbs goal but I don't excessively calculate what I eat. Now, I kind of know how much I should be eating to hit my goals. For gym, I realized I get my back injured a lot so I stopped doing heavy squats or deadlifting. Now, I use smith machine for almost everything and I stopped doing heavy weight training like before. I focus more on the hypertrophy and being healthy. 

If you have any questions, always feel free to reach out! I am quite petite and you may think I don't know anything nor realize I workout. Well, why don't we go to the gym and you can see how STRONG I am!
