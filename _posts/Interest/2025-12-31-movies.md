I love watching the same movies over and over again. Everytime you watch it, you get different perspectives, different feelings, and different discoveries. Also, it hits different depending on your age too which is also pretty interesting. It's like peeling layers of onions. I would like to say I got good taste in movies. I love movies that are very well made. It could have a great plot, phenominal cinematic effect, makes you think deeply, or even all. These are some movies that I really liked. Go take a peek! If you have any recommendations, let me know!

**Shrek**

I recently watched Shrek series like 7 times in the span of 7 days. It's a very well made movie.
