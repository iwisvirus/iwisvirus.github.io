I have been in the hospitality environment for over 4 years. I started off at a korean barbeque restaurant called Daldongnae. I worked there for 4 and a half year as a server. In the beginning, I did struggle a lot. I was getting shit on by my boss almost everyday. But I stayed and I grew STRONGER! I became one of the best(fastest) worker in 2 months. Though, I was lowkey struggling with customer service since I am quite a blunt person. I used to get quite a few bad reviews lol. For the last 2 years of working there, I worked on it a lot and I never got it after that. After working around 4 years, I figured I don't have much to learn from that place. I mean as any hospitality workers, I hopped around a bit from places to places, and I really wanted ot learn bartending.

Luckily enough, the owner at the bar I currently work at saw my potential and took me in. I am quite grateful for it actually. But yeah, I've been learning bartending. Yesterday, I kinda realized that I get excited when I go to the customer and get their drink orders. I also get excited making the drinks. Well well well... that is a good sign I guess. I found another passion of mine. 

I was thinking about what aspect of it I like. I think the biggest part is the crafting aspect of it. I used to do a lot of craftings when I was young. I used to build a lot of gundams, puzzles, and just whatver that's hands on I would say I'm pretty good at it and I really enjoy it. With making cocktails, it's not too complicated like cooking where you have to care about the heat,
